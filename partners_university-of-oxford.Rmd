The University of Oxford and University of Sheffield co-founded **OxShef: dataviz** in late 2017 to provide open source tutorials and advice to researchers on using interactive data visualisations to promote engagement directly with datasets and to broaden research impact.

Oxford's contribution to the project is spearheaded by Academic IT Research Support from IT Services and the [Interactive Data Network](http://idn.it.ox.ac.uk){target='_blank'}.

**OxShef: dataviz** resources are designed to be of general use to all academics, however there is dedicated support available to University of Oxford researchers and academics detailed below.

# Interactive Data Network

The [Interactive Data Network](http://idn.it.ox.ac.uk) provides specialist support and advice for researchers at University of Oxford in the use of the interactive data visualisations and in good research data management/reproducible research standards.

The IDN aims to host visualisations on behalf of Oxford researchers using all of the technologies covered by **OxShef:


## Hosting of Shiny apps



# Old Content


 The IDN sits inside of Academic Support IT, which provides a more general advice service on research data management to researchers.

To contact the IDN team please email us at <researchsupport@it.ox.ac.uk> and we'll get back to you ASAP to arrange a virtual or in person meeting at your building or IT Services on Banbury Road.

# Support for Oxford Researchers

The IDN provides support for all researchers and academics at University of Oxford in the following areas:

## Shiny apps hosting {.tabset}

Shiny allows users of R to create web applications without learning HTML, CSS or JavaScript - learn more at the dedicated Shiny website.

The IDN will host Shiny apps developed by (or on behalf of) Oxford researchers provided they meet the following requirements:

- The Shiny app visualises/explains research outputs of Oxford researchers
- All data displayed by the app is deposited in (and accessed from) a DOI issuing data repository
- The code for the Shiny app is also deposited in a DOI issuing data repository
- The Shiny app contains the DOI for the underlying code and data

Please visit the dedicated [IDN Showcase](https://idn.it.ox.ac.uk/visualisation-showcase) for examples of Shiny apps built and hosted by the IDN.
