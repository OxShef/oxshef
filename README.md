# OxShef: Promoting Interactive Data Visualisation for Communicating Research Outputs

OxShef is a joint collaboration between the [Interactive Data Network of University of Oxford](idn.it.ox.ac.uk) and [Research Software Engineering at University of Sheffield](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/). The goal of OxShef is as follows:

> Promote, support and teach researchers about how interactive data visualisation can aid in increasing the impact and engagement with research outputs

We have a network of websites hosted on Github Pages to achieve this goal, the most generally useful to all researchers is:

- [OxShef: Charts](https://github.com/OxShef/oxshef_charts): An overview of common data visualisation charts, maps, graphs and more. Use this website to help pick which visualisations best suit your data and for advice on avoiding common pitfalls or complications in data visualisation
