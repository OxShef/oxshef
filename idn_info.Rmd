The [Interactive Data Network](http://idn.it.ox.ac.uk) provides specialist support and advice for researchers at University of Oxford in the use of the interactive data visualisations. The IDN sits inside of Academic Support IT, which provides a more general advice service on research data management to researchers.

To contact the IDN team please email us at <researchsupport@it.ox.ac.uk> and we'll get back to you ASAP to arrange a virtual or in person meeting at your building or IT Services on Banbury Road.

# Support for Oxford Researchers

The OxShef project is a collaboration between Oxford and Sheffield to provide advice on using interactive data visualisation for all academics/researchers - independent of their home institution. However, there are a number of hosting services that the IDN provides exclusively for researchers at Oxford. 

## Shiny apps hosting {.tabset}

Shiny allows users of R to create web applications without learning HTML, CSS or JavaScript - learn more at the dedicated Shiny website.

The IDN will host Shiny apps developed by (or on behalf of) Oxford researchers provided they meet the following requirements:

- The Shiny app visualises/explains research outputs of Oxford researchers
- All data displayed by the app is deposited in (and accessed from) a DOI issuing data repository
- The code for the Shiny app is also deposited in a DOI issuing data repository
- The Shiny app contains the DOI for the underlying code and data

Please visit the dedicated [IDN Showcase](https://idn.it.ox.ac.uk/visualisation-showcase) for examples of Shiny apps built and hosted by the IDN.
